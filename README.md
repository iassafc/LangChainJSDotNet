⚡ A thin .NET wrapper around the official LangChain.js library⚡

Looking for the official JS/TS or Python versions of LangChain? Check out:

* [LangChain.js](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs) (JS/TS)
* [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) (Python)


## 🤔 What is this?

**LangChainJSDotNet** provides a seamless interface for .NET developers to run LangChain based code with minimal adjustments.

The official JS/TS version tracks the official Python version closely, therefore LangChain code could be easily ported and run in .NET using **LangChainJSDotNet**, potentially exposing all of the latest AI advancements and features from LangChain and its vast ecosystem to .NET developers.

While integrating Python code in .NET presents challenges, Microsoft's [ClearScript](https://github.com/microsoft/ClearScript) library greatly simplifies the integration process with JavaScript code. Hence, for now, this library focuses exclusively on wrapping the JS version of LangChain.
